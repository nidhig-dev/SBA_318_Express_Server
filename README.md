     "description": "A powerful and moving saga of five extraordinary members of the Harvard class of 1958 and the women with whom their lives are intertwined. Their explosive story begins in a time of innocence and spans a turbulent quarter century, culminating in their dramatic twenty-five reunion at which they confront their classmates--and the balance sheet of their own lives. Always at the center; amid the passion, laughter, and glory, stands Harvard--the symbol of who they are and who they will be. They were a generation who made the rules--then broke them--whose glittering successes, heartfelt tragedies, and unbridled ambitions would stun the world.",

    }

DELETE method:`http://localhost:3000/books/admin/:id`-Delete a book based on book id
Query parameter: role:admin


**With Template engine**
- `http://localhost:3000/` renders login page (libNum.ejs) via userRoute.mjs. 
- Ids 2,3,4,5 are regular users and will take you to user books page.
- If you enter "1" you will be rendered Admin Page (admin.ejs) via adminRoute.ejs.

    - This page gives you access to see book inventory. The admin will also see **bookId** of a book.
    - Add/Create a new book entry using post method.
    ## Validation: 
    - If book title (case insensitive)matches exactly with entered title, it will throw error.
    - If any field is empty, it will throw error.

    - Sample data of book entry:

    * Title- The Class
    * Release Date- Jan 1, 1986
    * Description- A powerful and moving saga of five extraordinary members of the Harvard class of 1958 and the women with whom their lives are intertwined.

Always at the center; amid the passion, laughter, and glory, stands Harvard--the symbol of who they are and who they will be. They were a generation who made the rules--then broke them--whose glittering successes, heartfelt tragedies, and unbridled ambitions would stun the world.
