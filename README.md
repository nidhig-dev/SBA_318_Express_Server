# Library Management System ðŸ“š

This project is a **Node.js + Express** web application that manages a libraryâ€™s books, users, and borrowing system.  
It uses **EJS view engine** for rendering pages and supports both **admin** and **user** roles.

## How to Test
**With Thunderclient/Postman**

**With Template engine**
- `http://localhost:3000/` renders login page (libNum.ejs) via userRoute.mjs. 
- If you enter "1" you will be rendered Admin Page (admin.ejs).
    - This page gives you access to see book inventory. The admin will also see **bookId**
    - Add/Create a new book entry using post method.
    ## Validation: 
    - If book title (case insensitive)matches exactly with entered title
    - If any field is empty
    - Sample data of book entry:



- Other ids of user databse are regular users and will take you to books page.
- booksAdminRoute is restricted to admins only. needs query parameters and body property `admin`.Best to check with template engine.
- userRoute is used by template view engine only to redirect the user based on userId/Library Number.
