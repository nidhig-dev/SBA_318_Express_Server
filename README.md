# Library Management System üìö

This project is a **Node.js + Express** web application that manages a library‚Äôs books, users, and borrowing system.  
It uses **EJS view engine** for rendering pages and supports both **admin** and **user** roles.

## üìö Library API Endpoints

------

## How to Test

### Assumption
**number (userId), BookId, loadId** are unique identifiers, are sequentially generated in post method, hence can't be edited to preserve the sequence.

**With Thunderclient/Postman**
- GET method: `http://localhost:3000/books/admin`-Get all books
    - Query Parameter: role:admin

- POST method:`http://localhost:3000/books/admin`-Add a book
    - Body:needs a property role with value admin.
    - Sample data:

    `{
     "role": "admin",
     "title": "The Class",
     "releaseDate": "Jan 1,1986",
     "description": "A powerful and moving saga of five extraordinary members of the Harvard class of 1958 and the women with whom their lives are intertwined. Their explosive story begins in a time of innocence and spans a turbulent quarter century, culminating in their dramatic twenty-five reunion at which they confront their classmates--and the balance sheet of their own lives. Always at the center; amid the passion, laughter, and glory, stands Harvard--the symbol of who they are and who they will be. They were a generation who made the rules--then broke them--whose glittering successes, heartfelt tragedies, and unbridled ambitions would stun the world.",
     "pages": 560,
     "cover": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rIay3vijL.jpg"
    }`

- PATCH method:`http://localhost:3000/books/admin/:id`-Update a book using book id

    - Query parameter: role:admin

    Sample Data-    
    `{
     "role": "admin",
     "title": "The Class",
     "releaseDate": "Jan 1,1986",
     "description": "A powerful and moving saga of five extraordinary members of the Harvard class of 1958 and the women with whom their lives are intertwined. Their explosive story begins in a time of innocence and spans a turbulent quarter century, culminating in their dramatic twenty-five reunion at which they confront their classmates--and the balance sheet of their own lives. Always at the center; amid the passion, laughter, and glory, stands Harvard--the symbol of who they are and who they will be. They were a generation who made the rules--then broke them--whose glittering successes, heartfelt tragedies, and unbridled ambitions would stun the world.",
     "pages": 560,
     "cover": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rIay3vijL.jpg"
    }`

- DELETE method:`http://localhost:3000/books/admin/:id`-Delete a book based on book id
    - Query parameter: role:admin


**With Template engine**
- `http://localhost:3000/` renders login page (libNum.ejs) via userRoute.mjs. 
- Ids 2,3,4,5 are regular users and will take you to user books page.
- If you enter **"1"** you will be rendered Admin Page (admin.ejs) via adminRoute.ejs.

    - This page gives you access to see book inventory. The admin will also see **bookId** of a book.
    - Add/Create a new book entry using post method.
    #### Validation for post method: 
    - If book title matches exactly with entered title, it will throw error. Book title validation is case insensitive. It will ignore Uppercase/LowerCase.
    - If any field is empty, it will throw error.
    - Pages need to be an integer. Else error will be thrown.
    - Release date needs to be in format "Jun 19,2005". 
        - Month needs to be **3 letters** followed by **space** followed by **1 or 2 digit** followed by **comma** followed by **4 digits**.
    - Cover page image format is http or https and valid extension.


 - Sample data of book entry:

    * Title- `The Class`
    * Release Date- `Jan 1,1986`
    * Description- `A powerful and moving saga of five extraordinary members of the Harvard class of 1958 and the women with whom their lives are intertwined. Their explosive story begins in a time of innocence and spans a turbulent quarter century, culminating in their dramatic twenty-five reunion at which they confront their classmates--and the balance sheet of their own lives. Always at the center; amid the passion, laughter, and glory, stands Harvard--the symbol of who they are and who they will be. They were a generation who made the rules--then broke them--whose glittering successes, heartfelt tragedies, and unbridled ambitions would stun the world.`
    * Pages- `560`,
    * Cover-`https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rIay3vijL.jpg`

## Routes
- **booksAdminRoute** is restricted to admins only.
    - GET/PATCH/DELETE method needs query parameter **role:admin** with thunderclient.Check with template engine to avoid this.
    - POST method needs body property **"role":"admin"** with thunderclient.Check with template engine to avoid this.

- **userRoute** is used by template view engine only to redirect the user based on userId/Library Number.
- **adminRoute** is used only by admin requests to render admin page
- **booksUserRoute** User gets routed to this route. He only has read access.
    - GET
    - GET by :id, :name
- **borrowBookRoute** only Admin has access to all methods - 

    - GET

    - GET by bookId
        - Query paramter:role : admin

    - POST
        - Query parameter: role : admin
    
    Sample data-

    `{
        "userId": 2,

        "borrowDate": "2025-08-25",
        "dueDate": "2025-09-09",

    }`

- ‚úÖCommit frequently to the git repository.
- ‚úÖInclude a README file that contains a description of your application.
- ‚úÖLevel of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.

## REFLECTIONS

- What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

    - I was manually checking in each admin method if the req.query.role is admin. I thought of adding middleware for the same at the end. If I had thought of it earlier, I could have saved a lot of time.

- what would you add or change about your application if you had more time?

    - I would add book checkout functionality for users on the books page if I had more time.
